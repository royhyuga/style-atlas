      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Lawrence return to Cannes 2025 in stunning fashion, redefining what elegance looks like on the red carpet in a new era of conscious glamour.</p>

      <h3>Angelina Jolie Returns to the Riviera</h3>
      <p>After 14 years away from the Cannes spotlight, Angelina Jolie made a sensational return wearing a champagne-hued cashmere gown. The look was classic, quiet, and commanding—an editorial nod to the golden age of Hollywood with a modern, minimalist twist.</p>

      <blockquote>“Cannes 2025 is not just about cinema. It’s about reshaping what red carpet fashion means in the era of authenticity.”</blockquote>

      <h3>Jennifer Lawrence and the Art of Subtle Power</h3>
      <p>Making her first red carpet appearance since welcoming her second child, Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a white strapless gown that radiated calm confidence. She was there for the premiere of her new film, "Die, My Love", and embodied effortless refinement.</p>

      <h3>Red Carpet, Redefined</h3>
      <p>This year, Cannes introduced new dress code rules banning “naked dresses.” The response was a wave of architectural silhouettes, heavier fabrics, and elegant restraint. The result? A runway of timelessness that felt refreshing—and overdue.</p>

      <h3>Editorial Elegance Takes Center Stage</h3>
      <p>The fashion at Cannes 2025 isn't about shock—it’s about shape, texture, presence. Think sculptural couture. Think narrative fashion. Think glamour as art direction. This is a new chapter for the red carpet, and it’s written in elegance.</p>

      <blockquote>“This red carpet is no longer a spectacle—it’s a story told in silk, silhouette, and strength.”</blockquote>
