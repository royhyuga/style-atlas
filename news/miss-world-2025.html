<p>On May 31, 2025, at the HITEX Exhibition Centre in Hyderabad, India, Suchata Chuangsri of Thailand was crowned Miss World 2025, marking the first-ever win for Thailand in the pageant's 72-year history. The event featured contestants from 108 countries and was co-hosted by Stephanie Del Valle and Sachiin Kumbhar, with performances by Bollywood stars Jacqueline Fernandez and Ishaan Khatter.</p>

<blockquote>“This victory is not just mine; it belongs to every young girl who dares to dream,” said Chuangsri during her acceptance speech.</blockquote>

<p>The pageant's new continent-based format advanced ten contestants from each of four regions to the Top 40, with judges selecting a Top 5 from each region to form the Top 20, and further narrowing to a Top 2 per region. The four regional winners became the overall Top 4 finalists, with one crowned Miss World and the others named runners-up.</p>

<p>Suchata Chuangsri emerged as the winner, with Hasset Dereje Admassu of Ethiopia as the first runner-up, Maja Klajda of Albania as the second runner-up, and Aurélie Joachim of Guadeloupe as the third runner-up. The Top 8 also included Jéssica Pedroso (Brazil), Selma Kamanya (Namibia), Krishnah Gravidez (Philippines), and Maria Melnychenko (Ukraine).</p>

<p>Special awards were presented, including the Humanitarian Award to Indian actor and philanthropist Sonu Sood for his charitable work during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Chuangsri's win is seen as a significant moment for Thailand, inspiring many in her home country and across Southeast Asia. Her poise, intelligence, and commitment to social causes resonated with both judges and audiences worldwide.</p>
