      <h2>Cannes 2025 Has Begun — And the Red Carpet Is Already a War of Style</h2>
      <img src="../images/news/cannes-news-cover.jpg" alt="Cannes 2025 Fashion" style="width:100%;max-width:700px;margin:1rem auto;display:block;border-radius:12px;" />
      <p class="resumen-noticia"><strong>The Cannes Film Festival kicked off yesterday, and fashion has already taken center stage — from transparent gowns to unexpected suits, 2025's red carpet is rewriting rules with every step.</strong></p>

      <p>With the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival officially underway, it’s not just cinema that’s drawing all the lights — it’s the steps leading up to the Palais des Festivals. And this year, the carpet isn’t red. It’s radioactive.</p>
      <p>From opening night, it was clear that 2025’s fashion narrative would not be about minimalism. Dresses came dripping in sequins, lace returned with a vengeance, and tailoring? Sharper than ever.</p>

      <blockquote style="font-style: italic; font-size: 1.2rem; border-left: 4px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
        “Cannes isn’t just a film festival — it’s a runway with global broadcast.”  
      </blockquote>

      <p>Among the standouts: an architectural metallic gown worn by an emerging Italian actress, a fully sheer but flawlessly styled ensemble by a Korean pop icon, and a French designer debuting a hand-embroidered dress inspired by 1960s cinema posters.</p>
      <p>It’s not all chaos. There’s precision. Intent. Even irony. More than once, designers seemed to wink at tradition — twisting it just enough to keep elegance intact while subverting the silhouette.</p>

      <p>Beyond the outfits, the message is clear: self-expression wins. There's no longer a single dress code at Cannes. Velvet suits, opera gloves, sculptural collars and combat boots — all walked the same stairs.</p>

      <p>What’s behind this shift? TikTok’s rise as a real-time commentator. Fashion houses betting on boldness. And a younger generation of actors who dress like they write the script — not read from it.</p>

      <p>The days ahead will bring more premieres and more risks. But one thing is certain: Cannes 2025 has already delivered a visual manifesto — and the week has just begun.</p>
